# School_District_Analysis
# A Written Report for the School District Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This analysis aimed to look at schools to see if the 9th-grade reading and math scores were evidence of academic dishonesty.

## Results:

-How is the district summary affected?
As it can be seen in the two pictures, the average grades for math and reading higher are the same no matter if the 9th graders are included. https://github.com/samnougues/School_District_Analysis/blob/051e0581bcd45440945e6d5ad0f71a4641350175/School_District_Analysis/school%20summary%20no%209th%20grade.png

-How is the school summary affected?
In the Thomas School, average scores are much different. 

-How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
Without the ninth graders, there is a higher rate of passing.

-How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

-Math and reading scores by grade
It does not affect any grade other than the ninth grade.

-Scores by school spending
There does not seem to be a big difference

-Scores by school size
This does not seem to be affected

-Scores by school type
This also doesn't seem to effect anything

## School District Analysis Summary:

-There does not seem to be a big difference between the data before or after changing the ninth-grade test scores. I do not think there was any academic dishonesty.
